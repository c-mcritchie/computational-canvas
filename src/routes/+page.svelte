		<hr/>
		<p>Welcome to the <span class="rainbow">Computational Canvas</span>, where a computer science major fell into
		the different worlds of the social sciences, humanities, and the fine arts as they converge with computer science.
		As I was researching these topics, I found myself falling deeper and deeper into their respective rabbit holes.
		During my journey, I documented my findings and where they were sourced from using the IEEE citation style.
		While reading my research, each in text citation is a clickable link that will take you to the full citation
		on the references page. I hope you enjoy exploring computer science through the different worlds of the social
		sciences, humanities, and the fine arts as much as I did. To embark on this journey, click on one of the buttons below.
		I recommend starting with the social sciences, then working your way through the humanities and lastly the fine arts,
		but feel free to explore in any order you wish. Enjoy!
